pyruvate-deydrogenase
* 

Acetyl-CoA --> 

Part of TCA cycle:
Alpha-Keto-Gluterate-Dehydrogenase
* Not only involved in the breakdown of macronutrients.
* Also part of neurotransmitter synthesis, like:
* Glutamate, GABA, aspartate. (neurotransmitter inbalance)
* 

Co-factor to:
Branch-chain-alpha-keto-acid-dehydrogenase
involved in the conversion of lysine into isovaleryl-coA (related to amino-acid metabolism).


Thiamine deficiency will hit all cells in the body! (chronic disorders ?)

Thiamine is important for fat metabolism in the TCA cycle.

When pyruvate-deydrogenase is inhibited, then pyruvate is rooted towards lactic acid.
Glucose is then rooted towards the cori cycle, which recycles the lactic acid by the liver so that it can be used again.
This process costs ATP to make glucose again from lactate.

Not a good thing to create lactate in excesive amount.
